Ranger
==============
Ranger is a zero-effort self-deployable indoor navigation system. The idea originates from an ACM MobiCom 2014 paper: Travi-Navi.
Comparing to Travi-Navi, Ranger successfully get rid of vision-guiding part. Hence, as far as we know, Ranger is the most
effortless indoor navigation system which does not require any artificial survey of indoor environment. Feel free to use it.
It is EXTREMELY easy to use.
